## PyPIC3D

PyPIC3D is a three-dimensional particle-in-cell plasma simulation code written
in Python with JAX. The production runtime keeps fields and particles in a
shared tile layout and is configured through TOML:

```bash
PyPIC3D --config path/to/config.toml
```

## What It Does

- Pushes tile-local particle species with Boris or Higuera-Cary methods.
- Deposits current with direct `j_from_rhov` or charge-conserving Esirkepov
  deposition.
- Evolves electromagnetic fields with a staggered Yee update or solves the
  electrostatic Poisson problem.
- Exchanges field halos and moving particles across a JAX device mesh.
- Writes energy and momentum traces plus optional asynchronous openPMD field
  and particle output.

## Installation

From PyPI:

```bash
pip install PyPIC3D
```

From source:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd PyPIC3D
pip install .
```

For development:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

Run the single-tile two-stream demo from the repository root:

```bash
PyPIC3D --config demos/two_stream/two_stream.toml
```

Simulation outputs are written under `<output_dir>/data`. See the
[usage guide](docs/usage.rst) for the active TOML options and the
[tiling guide](docs/tiling.rst) before selecting a multi-tile layout.

## Documentation Map

The Sphinx documentation lives in `docs/`:

- `usage.rst`: CLI configuration, external fields, PML, and outputs.
- `tiling.rst`: tile geometry, device topology, guard cells, and particle
  capacity.
- `solvers.rst`: electrodynamic and electrostatic update paths.
- `chargeconservation.rst`: current deposition and filtering.
- `grid.rst`: coordinate grids, Yee staggering, and boundaries.
- `particles.rst`: species initialization and tiled particle state.
- `demos.rst`: runnable examples.
- `architecture.rst`: runtime objects, modules, and data flow.
- `development.rst`: setup, tests, documentation builds, and debugging.

## Testing

A suite of lightweight API call and implementation tests can be run with:

```bash
pytest tests/code_tests
```

A suite of lightweight physics based tests to verify the correctness of the implementation can be run with:

```bash
pytest tests/physics_tests
```

## Performance benchmarks

The reproducible CPU benchmark scans particle count, cell count, and JAX CPU
device count; records synchronized steady-state step and component timings; and
generates problem-size, strong-scaling, and weak-scaling plots:

```bash
python benchmarks/scaling_benchmark.py --output benchmarks/results
```

See [`benchmarks/README.md`](benchmarks/README.md) for methodology, output
interpretation, larger-run examples, and bottleneck-analysis guidance.

## Build Docs

pip install -r docs/requirements.in
