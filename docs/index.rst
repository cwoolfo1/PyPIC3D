PyPIC3D
=====================

.. container:: hero

   PyPIC3D is a JAX-based particle-in-cell code for
   electrodynamic and electrostatic plasma simulations. PyPIC3D 
   features domain decomposition and is parallelized using the
   JAX XLA compiler across tiles and devices. Simulations can be
   configured using either TOML configuration files or within 
   Python scripts. The code is designed to be lightweight and 
   easy to modify for rapid development of new numerical methods.

   **Focused for researchers**

   PyPIC3D keeps the particle push, deposition, Yee staggering, ghost cells,
   and boundary operations visible so new numerical methods can be evaluated
   and prototyped without a large framework layer.
